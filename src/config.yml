# Sadly there is no nice way to have friendly names. As such,
#  the material values are used. For instance, the default tool
#  bindings are scroll tool to bone, which is 352, and the
#  duplicator tool is the stone axe, or 275. test
# 
# debug: <true|false>
#    Don't enable this unless you want a bunch of data dumped
#    to the console logs.
# 
# permissions: <true|false>
#    While permissions are very handy and often the best way
#    to control the use of tools, some people do not like them.
#    If that is the case, set this to false to disable
#    permission checking.
# 
# tools: bind: <tool>: <id>
#    This gives a mapping of what item to use for what tool.
#    If a tool is not wanted, you can disable it by removing
#    the permission from the (or all) user(s). If you want to 
#    run the server without permissions, it is suggested to 
#    remove it by adding a '#' to the beginning of the line.
#    However, setting it's value to zero will also disable 
#    the tool, it but with a warning to the console.
# 
# tools: dupe: replace: <id>: <id>
#    This gives additional mappings of what a duplicated block
#    should give the player. For instance, 7: 260 means that when
#    a user tries to duplicate bedrock, they get apples instead.
#    If you want to override the default replacement, just redefine
#    it here.
# 
# tools: dupe: keepData: [<id>, ...]
#    This tells the tool what items should keep their data value.
#    Do not change this unless you understand data values, and what
#    they mean when items in your hand have data values.
#    SUGGESTION: If a value above is 'replace'd, remove it from
#        the keepData field as well.
# 
# tools: scroll: override: <true|false>
#    By default there are only certain types of materials that can
#    be scrolled. If you want to allow your users to only access a
#    subset of those items, enable the override, and set the desired
#    materials in the below list
# 
# tools: scroll: allow: [ <id>, ...]
#    If the above override is set, only materials that are listed
#    here and are supported by the scroll tool will scroll for users.
